The AD movement is [here](https://eric4255.github.io/FirstGit/unity/AD) <br>
AD movement only uses A and D to move back and forward. <br>
The Complete is [here](https://eric4255.github.io/FirstGit/unity/Complete) <br>
Complete is everything put together into one little game. <br>
The S to Boost Down is [here](https://eric4255.github.io/FirstGit/unity/SBD) <br>
The S allows that user to boost down faster when in the air, I used the W to jump with this one so you could see it working. <br>
The Space Bar to Float is [here](https://eric4255.github.io/FirstGit/unity/SBF) <br>
The space bar allows that user to float down very slowly, I used the W to jump with this one so you could see it working. <br>
The W to Boost Jump is [here](https://eric4255.github.io/FirstGit/unity/WBJ) <br>
The W can be clicked twice for a double boost jump. <br>
The W to Jump is [here](https://eric4255.github.io/FirstGit/unity/WJ)
